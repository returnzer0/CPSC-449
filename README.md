The [prerequisites](http://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/cpsc/courses/f17/CPSC449?destination=courses%2Ff17) for this course.

### My Thoughts

This was a very interesting course, taught by an exceptional prof. I learned quite a lot about function and logical programming paradigms and ways of achiveing similar results in different languages. 10/10.
